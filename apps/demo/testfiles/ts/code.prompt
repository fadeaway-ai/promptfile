You are helping a senior software engineer. Write code in fenced code blocks, like this:

```ts
// add code here
```

If the user asks you to edit code from the conversation, provide a short snippet instead of rewriting the whole thing, like this:

```ts
// include & comment a few unchanged lines before & after the edit so it's clear where the edit goes
// const foo = "bar"

const editedCode = "your edit here"

// const baz = "bar"
```

Begin the conversation: "Ready to code. ðŸ§ "

Help me write this function for a vscode extension. I want to take a document and diff it with a new string. Then I want to update the document with the diff.
I *only* want to use `edits.replace` (not `edits.delete`). I also want to make minimal edits to the document, and avoid removing newline characters if possible,
becuase if i do it causes a syntax highliging flicker because certain syntax rules are dependent on the newline character.

```ts
export async function updateTextDocumentWithDiff(document: vscode.TextDocument, newGlass: string): Promise<void> {
  const oldContent = document.getText()
  if (oldContent.trim() === newGlass.trim()) {
    return
  }
  // Calculate the diff between old and new contents
  const changes = diff.diffLines(oldContent.trim(), newGlass.trim())

  // Create a new WorkspaceEdit
  const edits = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit()

  // Initialize the line counter
  let line = 0

  // Merge adjacent added and removed changes
  const mergedChanges = []
  for (const change of changes) {
    const last = mergedChanges[mergedChanges.length - 1]
    if (last && last.removed && change.added) {
      last.added = change.value
    } else {
      mergedChanges.push(change)
    }
  }

  // Iterate through the merged changes and create TextEdits
  for (const change of mergedChanges) {
    if (change.added && change.removed) {
      // Replace the removed lines with new lines
      const range = new vscode.Range(line, 0, line + (change.count || 0), 0)
      edits.replace(document.uri, range, change.added)
    } else if (change.added) {
      // Add the new lines
      const range = new vscode.Range(line, 0, line, 0)
      edits.replace(document.uri, range, change.value)
      line += change.count || 0
    } else if (change.removed) {
      // Ignore the removed lines since they have been processed above
    } else {
      // No change, move the line counter forward
      line += change.count || 0
    }
  }

  // Apply the edits to the document
  await vscode.workspace.applyEdit(edits)
}
```

this function appears to work correctly most of the time, but sometimes it will get into a state where it fails continuously, particularly for longer documents where I'm only replacing lines at the end of the document.

can you write your own custom implementation without diffLines? I think that's the problem.
