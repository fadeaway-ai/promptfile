Awesome, you're well on your way to working with Glass!

Being able to run a prompt once is great, but what if you want to run it multiple times? Language models are particularly skilled at back-and-forth conversations, so let's try that out.

Instead of typing your input into the `User` block, let's use a variable instead.

<Test>
// you can write Typescript to establish your variable values
return [
  {
    myFirstVariable: 'Tell me a story about the moon',
  },
]
</Test>

same System prompt as before...
<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.
</System>

...but let's use a variable for the User's input!
<User>
@{myFirstVariable}
</User>

Remember, cmd+enter on Mac / ctrl+enter on Windows to run in the Playground!
