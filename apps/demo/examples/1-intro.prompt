model: gpt-3.5-turbo

Welcome to Promptfile! Promptfile is a Markdown-like file format for working with language models. To help you learn Promptfile, we'll work through a few examples together and build some LLM applications. We'll start simple by using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model from OpenAI to generate haikus.

This prompt contains two chat blocks: a System block and a User block. The System block (`<System>`) gives initial instructions to the language model, setting the scene. The User block (`<User>`) represents the user's input or query to the language model.

If you're unfamilar with chat blocks in the context of prompting, you can learn more from docs provided by OpenAI (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api) and Anthropic (https://console.anthropic.com/docs/prompt-design).

To start, try executing this prompt by using the `Promptfile: run in playground` command. You can find this command by opening the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows) and searching for `Promptfile`.

You can also execute this command via the keyboard shortcut Cmd+Enter (Mac) / Ctrl+Enter (Windows).
