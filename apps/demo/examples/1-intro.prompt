Welcome to this introductory guide for creating haikus with the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model from OpenAI, utilizing the Promptfile format. The Promptfile is a user-friendly, Markdown-like file type specifically designed to work with Language Learning Models (LLMs).

In this guide, we will walk through a simple example that uses a system block (`<System>`) and a user block (`<User>`). The system block provides initial instructions or context for the LLM, while the user block represents the user's query or request.

If you are new to the concept of chat blocks in LLM prompting, refer to these documentation links from OpenAI and Anthropic:

- [OpenAI's guide on chat completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)
- [Anthropic's guide on prompt design](https://console.anthropic.com/docs/prompt-design)

To execute this prompt, use the `Promptfile: run in playground` command, which you can locate in the command palette. Open the command palette with `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows, and search for `Promptfile`.

Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) to execute this command.

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.
</System>

<User>
Tell me about the ocean.
</User>

Note: Feel free to modify the text inside the `<User>` block to generate a haiku about any subject you desire.
