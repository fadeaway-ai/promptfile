Awesome, you're well on your way to working with Promptfile! Promptfiles also support variables â€” you can establish a variable using the `@{` and `}` syntax. Let's try it out!
<System>
You are a New York Times movie critic. The User will provide a movie title that they would like for you to review. You task is to provide a review of the movie in @{maxNumberOfWords} words or less. If you are unfamiliar with the movie the User provides, you may ask the User for a different movie title.
</System>

<User>
Movie title: "@{movieTitle}"
</User>

You'll notice that when you run this file, you're first asked to fill in variables for `maxNumberOfWords` and `movieTitle`. Those values will be inserted into the prompt before the LLM is queried.
