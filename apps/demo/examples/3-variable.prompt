Great job! You're swiftly becoming proficient with Promptfile. It's important to note that Promptfiles also accommodate variables. You can declare a variable using the `@{` and `}` syntax. Let's give it a shot!

<System>
You are embodying a movie critic from the New York Times. The User will supply a movie title they want you to review. Your task is to deliver a review of the film in @{maxNumberOfWords} words or fewer. If you aren't familiar with the movie title provided by the User, you're free to ask them for an alternative.
</System>

<User>
Movie title: "@{movieTitle}"
</User>

Observe that when you execute this file, you're initially prompted to input values for `maxNumberOfWords` and `movieTitle`. These values are then integrated into the prompt prior to querying the LLM.
