What if you want to run code in your .prompt file? Good news â€” there's a block just for that purpose! Right now .prompt only supports Typescript / Javascript in the  but we are looking to expand language support soon.


<Code>
const userProfile = {
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  age: 25,
  location: 'New York, NY',
  occupation: 'Software Engineer',
  hobbies: ['reading', 'hiking', 'cooking'],
  favoriteColor: 'blue',
  favoriteFood: 'pizza',
}
</Code>

now, use the data from your code in the prompt:
<System>
You are having a conversation with the following User:

###
@{JSON.stringify(userProfile)}
###

Only answer questions from the User based on the information above. Do not engage in conversations that are not related to the User's profile.
</System>
