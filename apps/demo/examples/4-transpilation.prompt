You may be wondering — how do I use these prompts in my codebase? Promptfiles come with a built-in transpiler that can convert them into your language of choice.

Try transpiling this code by using the `Promptfile: transpile to another language` command. You can find this command by opening the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows) and searching for `Promptfile`.

The output will be a clean code file that is ready to use in your project. Just save the file and use it like you would any other file in your project — no need to install external dependencies.
