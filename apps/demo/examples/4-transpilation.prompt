You might be asking — how can I utilize these prompts in my existing codebase? Well, Promptfiles come with an integrated transpiler capable of converting them into your preferred programming language.

You can attempt to transpile this code using the `Promptfile: transpile to another language` command. This command is accessible by opening the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows) and typing `Promptfile` into the search field.

The result will be a tidy code file ready for inclusion in your project. Simply save the file and treat it like any other file in your project — no need to install additional external dependencies.
