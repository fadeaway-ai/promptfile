# `.prompt` demos

This folder contains examples of using `.prompt`. The best place to start is [Examples](./examples).

This folder is also used as the default workspace when launching/developing the `vscode-prompt` extension; this way as you're developing `.prompt`,
you can easily test your changes across all of the examples.
