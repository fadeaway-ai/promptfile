// Welcome to Glass!

// Glass provides a first-class developer experience for working with LLMs.  
// Learning Glass is as simple as playing with a few example Glass files.

// Let's start with a simple interaction with gpt-3.5-turbo, the formal name for ChatGPT.

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.
</System>

// Now add some text below between <User> and </User>.

<User>
Hey, how are you?
</User>

<Request model="gpt-3.5-turbo" />

// Then, run the `Glass: run file` command to generate a completion.
// You can do this by opening up the VSCode command menu `command+shift+P`
// and selecting the `Glass: run file` command.

// This is equivalent to hitting the OpenAI API with two chat blocks:
// {role: 'system', content: 'You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.'}
// {role: 'user', content: 'Hey, how are you?'}
