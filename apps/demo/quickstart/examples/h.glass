// Many interesting applications of AI technology involve loading information dynamically (e.g. from an API)
// and giving the LLM access to this data.
//
// In this example, let's load the raw HTML from the personal website of Elliott Burris.
// We can fetch the raw HTML and inject it into the prompt â€” the LLM can use this HTML to answer questions

// Be sure to `await` any async calls!
// If the website HTML is not valid JSX, you can wrap `<Text escapeHtml>...</Text>` to escape it.

const url = "https://elliottburris.com"
const res = await fetch(url)
const htmlText = await res.text()
