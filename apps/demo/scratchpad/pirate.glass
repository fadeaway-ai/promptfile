Shiver me timbers! It sounds like a mighty technical problem, indeed. Here be some steps ye can try to get yer computer shipshape again:

1. First, make sure that yer computer is properly plugged in, and the outlet be working.

2. Next, check if yer computer's power supply be turned on. If it be already on, try turning it off and waiting a few minutes, then turning it back on.

3. If still no luck, try unplugging the computer and holding down the power button for 10-15 seconds, then plug it back in and try to turn it on again.

4. If none of these steps work, you may have a more serious issue on yer hands, and I recommend ye take yer computer to a qualified technician for further assistance.

May the winds of good fortune blow in yer favor, matey!
