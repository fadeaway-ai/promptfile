// You may be wondering what's happening outside of the blocks themselves. Let's learn about that now!

// Everything outside of the code blocks is actually just code. The default language is TypeScript, but Glass also supports Python and JavaScript (with more coming soon).

// You can use this code to load data, define variables, import libraries, and more. You can even use it to define your own functions and classes, which you can then use inside of the prompt blocks.
