# Glass

Glass is an open-source, declarative framework to build applications using large language models (LLMs).

Glass has a number of features purpose-built for building and iterating with language models:

- **Playground in VSCode** - Iterate and test your prompts where you work... in VSCode
- **Create more complex, dynamic prompts** - Execute code in your prompt, create templates, add conditional logic, and chain prompts together
- **Developer-first features** -Count tokens, switch models quickly, create test cases, import logic from your codebase, and call your prompts as a typesafe function

The fastest way to learn about Glass is to install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass) and follow the [Quickstart](/quickstart).

## Why Glass?

When we were building things in production with LLMs, we were writing prompts that looked like this:

```ts
/**
 * Construct a few-shot request to ask the LLM to write some basic code.
 */
function makeRequest(task: string) {
  return [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: `You are a highly-intelligent AI that writes amazing JavaScript code.

Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks below given the following schema:

\`\`\`ts
interface User {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
}
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `delete the firstName field`,
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: `\`\`\`js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  delete newRow.firstName
  return newRow
})
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `update age to 22`,
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: `\`\`\`js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  newRow.age = 22
  return newRow
})
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `${task}`,
    },
  ]
}
```

It was useful to separate our prompt constructors into a different file. But, that wasn't enough...we wanted something specially built for writing prompts.

Glass is similar to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) but adds a number of features that make it easier to write prompts for LLMs.

Here's what the same prompt looks like in Glass:

````glass-ts
<System>
You are a highly-intelligent AI that writes amazing JavaScript code.

Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks below given the following schema:

```ts
interface User {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
}
```
</System>


<User>
delete the firstName field
</User>


<Assistant>
```js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  delete newRow.firstName
  return newRow
})
```
</Assistant>


<User>
update age to 22
</User>


<Assistant>
```js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  newRow.age = 22
  return newRow
})
```
</Assistant>


<User>
${task}
</User>
````
