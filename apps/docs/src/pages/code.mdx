# How to write code inside your prompt



<Note>

Anything written outside of a block is evaluated as code. We think this is one of the best parts about Glass...you can seamlessly move between code that you use to construct your prompt and the prompt itself.


</Note>


One of the most popular use cases for LLMs is increasingly in writing code or including code in your request. Glass makes this easy through its support of string interpolation (`${}`), code blocks (`<Code>`), and code snippets.

## Variable interpolation

You can include variables in your prompt by defining them in the `<Code>` block. You can then reference them in your prompt using string interpolation like `${someVariable}`. String interpolation defaults to JavaScript which can be changed in the front matter or in [VScode settings](/vscode)

## Executable Code

Glass supports executable code in your request. This is useful for retrieving information you want to include in your prompt.

You can import necessary libraries outside a code block before the code block. You can also import libraries inside the code block.

Any variables you want to use in your prompt must be defined in a code block.

The default language in these blocks is JavaScript, but you can specify the language (Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript are supported) by including it in the front matter.

## Code Snippets

Code snippets are ways to include code in your request that is not executed. Specify the language you are using. All languages supported by Markdown's code snippets are supported in Glass.
