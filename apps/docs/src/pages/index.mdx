# Glass

Glass is an open-source templating language built for prompting large language models (LLMs). {{ className: 'lead' }}

Glass has a number of features purpose-built for working with language models:

- **Developer-first experience for prompting** — Syntax highlighting, commenting, diagnostics, and IntelliSense for your prompts.
- **Built-in VSCode playground** - Bring the playground to where you build, securing prompts and API keys locally.
- **Simple chaining of prompts** - Chain prompts together to ma

The fastest way to learn about Glass is to follow the [Quickstart](/quickstart) and installing the VSCode extension.

## Why Glass?

{/* Feel like this example isn't the best anymore, most people are using Markdown or YAML to write prompts. Would be great to have one of those codegroup animations that have a slider to go from old code to new code. Think the below section seems redundant */}

We created Glass because conventional programming languages like Python and Typescript aren't well-suited for writing and managing prompts. Markdown like YAML or MDX are much better suited, but don't have the power features that developers need to write prompts. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Most developers end up storing prompts as large strings that look like this: {{className: 'lead'}}

<CodeGroup title="The old way of writing and storing prompts">

```ts
export function myAwesomePrompt(task: string) {
  return `You are a highly-intelligent AI that writes amazing Javascript code.  Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks below given the following schema:

### Row Schema
{
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
}
###

Task: delete the firstName field
Code:

\`\`\`javascript
context.rows = context.rows.map((r) => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r);
  delete newRow.firstName;
  return newRow;
});
\`\`\`

Task: ${task}
Code:
\`\`\`javascript
context.rows =`
}
```

```

These large strings can be hard to read, write, and maintain. They also don't provide functionality for comments, IntelliSense, or syntax highlighting. And you often need to do character escaping. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Glass files are written in a Markdown-like with a special syntax for interpolating code. This syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, and to be familiar to anyone who has used Markdown before. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This is how the same prompt looks as `myAwesomePrompt.glass`: {{ className: 'lead' }}

Glass also fully supports chat block prompt formats (used by `gpt-4` and `gpt-3.5-turbo`, among others). Here's `myAwesomePrompt.glass` rewritten to use the chat inference format and documented with comments.{{ className: 'lead' }}

This is just the start — the language also supports much more complicated concepts including conditionals, importing, fragments, code execution, and more. {{ className: 'lead' }}
