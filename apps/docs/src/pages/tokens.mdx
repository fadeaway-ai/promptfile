# Token counting

You can keep track of the amount of tokens inside your Glass file at the bottom of the editor. Currently we use <a href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken" target="_blank"> tiktoken</a> which is the one used by OpenAI.

Only things included after transpilation will be included against your token count. Therefore, anything outside of a block is not included in the token count. However, if you declare a variable outside of a block and then use string interpolation to include it inside a block, it will count against your token limit.

For example, comments **outside** blocks are ignored by the transpiler and are only used to add notes to your prompt. Comments using ` //` **inside** blocks will be included in the prompt. The best way to include comments in the prompt without counting against your token count is through string interpolation `${/*Comment here*/}`.

Currently, the displayed token count naively counts the number of tokens in the entire Glass file, but will be updating this to be more intelligent in calculating your token count.
