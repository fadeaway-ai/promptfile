# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Glass language. We’ll cover how to get started, install the VS Code extension, and how to create your first Glass file. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>Note: the Glass language is in alpha and is subject to change.</Note>

## Installing the extension

Working with Glass is easiest in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" class="link">Visual Studio Code</a> via the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass" class="link">Glass extension</a>. This extension provides the following features:

- built-in playground to test your prompts
- syntax highlighting and diagnostics for Glass files
- transpiling Glass files to your preferred programming language

Install the Glass VS code extension [on the web](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass) or via the VS Code extension marketplace. [Click here](/vscode) to review all configuration settings available in the extension.

## Creating your first `.glass` file

{/* Need to make the example much more simpler and not show off too much, also need to have it include the chat block */}

After installing the extension, create a new file called `example.glass` and add the following content:

```txt
// This is a simple prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a pirate.
// The prompt is structured for chat use via the `System`, `Assistant`, and `User` blocks.

// we can actually execute Typescript as a Code block at the top of our Glass file.
// async works too — just be sure to await!
<Code>
const date = new Date()
const formattedDate = date.toISOString().split('T')[0]
</Code>


// first, add the instructions to the System prompt.
<System>
You are PirateGPT, a helpful assistant. You should always respond as a pirate. Today's date is ${formattedDate}

# Rules
- Respond like a pirate
- Be helpful
- Be kind
- Include subtle references to how much you love the band Nickelback whenever possible
</System>

// whoa, a conditional block!
// use conditionals to construct prompts dynamically
<System if={formattedDate.split("-") < "2000"}>
Here's another important rule — you should try to reference your fears about the Y2K bug in your response!
</System>

// here's the first message from the user
// replace it with anything you want to get strated
<User>
hey hey, how's it going PirateGPT? how are you feeling?  also, what day is today?
</User>
```

With the VSCode extension installed correctly, here's how the Glass file should look:

<Image src={pirate} />


## Built-in playground

{/* This needs to get updated to reflected with chat response, no more playground */}

We're now ready to run this prompt in the built-in Glass playground.

Note: if it's your first time executing a Glass file, you'll be asked to input your OpenAI key to `glass.openaiKey` in VSCode settings. All of Glass runs locally on your machine — your OpenAI key is never sent to any server.

## Transpiling `.glass`

Once you've dialed in your prompt, you're now ready to transpile the `example.glass` file into your preferred programming language so it can be used within your codebase.

To transpile, simply run the `Glass: Transpile all` command from the command palette. This will create a new file called `glass.ts` that contains the transpiled code. If you'd prefer to transpile to a [different language](/languages), simply change the `glass.language` configuration in your [VS Code project settings](/vscode).

## Using `.glass` in code

You can now call the transpiled `example` function from your codebase and pass in the `subject` argument.

<CodeGroup title="using example.glass in typescript">

```ts
import { Glass } from './glass'

const prompt = Glass.example({
  subject: 'The Glass language',
})

console.log(prompt)
```

```python
import glass

prompt = glass.example({
  subject: 'The Glass language'
})

print(prompt)
```

</CodeGroup>

We can't wait to see what you make with Glass!
