# Glass

Glass is an open-source, declarative framework to build applications using large language models (LLMs).

Glass has a number of features purpose-built for building and iterating with language models:

- **Playground in VSCode** - Iterate and test your prompts where you work... in VSCode.
- **Create more complex, dynamic prompts** - Execute code in your prompt, create templates, add conditional logic, and chain prompts together
- **Developer-first features** -Count tokens, switch models quickly, create test cases, import logic from your codebase, and call your prompts as a typesafe function

The fastest way to learn about Glass is to follow the [Quickstart](/quickstart) and installing the VSCode extension.
