# What is the Playground?

The Promptfile Playground provides an interactive testing space for Promptfile files, making it easy to try your prompts. It features a Monaco-based editor, similar to VSCode, which offers syntax highlighting and formatting when enclosing code within triple backticks and the language identifier, like ```` ```js const foo = "bar" ``` ```` for JavaScript.

## Interacting with your Promptfile File
<Callout type="warning"> When running a file in the Playground, Promptfile appends some code to enable a back-and-forth with your prompt. Promptfile does not modify the actual file, just a temporary session file.</Callout>

To enable dynamic conversations with your prompt, Promptfile automatically adds a `<User>{:prompt}` block containing an uninitialized input variable, along with a `<Request>{:prompt}` block with the same arguments found in the most recent request.
For example:

```prompt
Copy code
<User>
@{input}
</User>
<Request args />
```
This automatic addition allows you to interact smoothly with your prompt, the `@{input}` variable is evaluated as the subsequent user message. To view the raw Promptfile file rendered in the Playground, click the `Open Session File` button.

## How to Use the Playground

<Steps>
### Create a workspace and create a new Promptfile file in VSCode
 - Need some inspiration? Check out our examples [here](/examples) and copy one into your Promptfile file.
### Launch the Playground:
   - Press `Command (⌘) + Enter (↩)`.
   OR
   - execute the `Promptfile: run` command from the VSCode command palette.
### Review Chat History
- Access your past requests and responses by clicking a session ID. This opens the selected conversation history as a Promptfile file in a new VSCode tab.
### Monitor Token Usage
- Keep track of your token usage at the bottom of the editor within your Promptfile file. Promptfile currently uses [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for token counting.
### Open the session Promptfile file
- To see what's displayed in the Playground, click `Open session file`.
### Share your Promptfile file as a GitHub Gist
- Click the share button to create a sharable GitHub Gist of your Promptfile file. Remember to set your GitHub access token for the GitHub REST API as GITHUB_API_KEY in a .env file or in your .zshrc file. This enables you to create Gists via the API.

## Keeping your file and Playground in sync

In the Playground, a status indicator is displayed next to the name of your Promptfile file. This helps you monitor the synchronization between the Promptfile Playground and any changes made to your file.

- Orange Dot: If you see an orange dot, it means the Playground is not using the most recent version of your Promptfile file. To update the Playground with your latest changes, click the `New Session` button to restart.
- No Dot: Your Playground is using your most recent version of your Promptfile file.
