# What is the Playground?

The Promptfile Playground offers an interactive environment to test your `.prompt` files, allowing you to easily experiment with your prompts. When using the Playground, syntax highlighting is maintained in both the 'Input' box and during the conversation rendering. To display your responses with syntax highlighting in the Playground, make sure to enclose them within triple backticks and language identifier. For instance, a JavaScript response from the LLM like the one below will be displayed neatly with syntax highlighting:

````prompt
<Assistant>
```js
const foo = "bar";
```
</Assistant>
````

## Interacting with your `.prompt` file

After you run your Promptfile in the Playground, you receive the response from the model you defined at the top of the file. In this case, we decide to use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. After we run the file, we have the option to continue the conversation by putting something in as a `Response`. Any response to the model in the playground will be wrapped up in an `<User>{:prompt}` block and appended to the conversation. You can see this after entering a response and opening up the session file in the top right-hand corner of the Playground.

## How to Use the Playground

<Steps>
### Create a new `.prompt` file in VS Code
 - Need some inspiration? Check out our examples [here](/examples) and copy one into your Promptfile.
### Launch the Playground:
   - Press `Command (⌘) + Enter (↩)`.
   OR
   - execute the `Promptfile: run playground` command from the VS Code Command Palette.

### Continue the conversation
- Simply input something into the `Response` variable to keep going back and forth with the LLM.
### Review Chat History
- Access your past requests and responses by clicking a session ID. This opens the selected conversation history as a Promptfile file in a new VS Code tab.
### Monitor Token Usage
- Keep track of your token usage at the bottom of the editor within your Promptfile. Promptfile currently uses [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for token counting.
### Open the session Promptfile
- To see what's displayed in the Playground, click `Open session file`.
### Share your Promptfile as a GitHub Gist
- To share your Promptfile as a GitHub Gist, create a personal-access token that has read/write ability to create a Gist. Learn how to do that [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#fine-grained-personal-access-tokens). Save your GitHub token in Promptfile settings by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P,` searching for Promptfile: open settings, and pasting your keys in the VS Code setting.

Alternatively, you can set your API key in your environment as either `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Keep your file and Playground in sync

In the Playground, a status indicator is displayed next to the name of your Promptfile. This helps you monitor the synchronization between the Promptfile Playground and any changes made to your file. If you make changes in your file, be sure to save them and then reload a `New Session` in the Playground for those changes to be applied.

- Orange Dot: If you see an orange dot, it means the Playground is not using the most recent version of your Promptfile. To update the Playground with your latest changes, click the `New Session` button to restart.
- No Dot: Your Playground is using your most recent version of your Promptfile.
