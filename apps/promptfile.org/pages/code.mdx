## Using `.prompt` in your project

Every `.prompt` file can be easily converted into your programming language of choice. Just run the `Promptfile: transpile to another language` command from VSCode and select your preferred language.

We believe that all transpiled `.prompt` files should be 100% idiomatic to the language you choose and require no dependencies.
