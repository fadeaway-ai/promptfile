# What are Blocks?

Blocks in Promptfile simplify LLM requests by making them easy to read and understand. They prevent common mistakes and give you more power to create complicated interactions with the LLM.

### Assistant
Use the `<Assistant>{:prompt}` to specify that the content is coming from the model

 - **name** <i>(optional string) </i>— Assign a name to the assistant.
 - **type** <i>(optional enumerated string)</i> — Automatically generated condition for tracking the assistant response type. Currently only `function_call`.

```prompt copy filename="assistantBlock_example.prompt"
<Assistant>
Hello human!
</Assistant>
```


### User

Use the `<User>{:prompt}` block to indicate the text originating from a human user.

 - **name** <i>(optional string)  </i> — Assign a name to the user.

```prompt copy filename="user_example.prompt"
<User>
Hello AI!
</User>

```
### System

Use the `<System>{:prompt}` block to provide instructions to the LLM.

For Anthropic models, the `<System>{:prompt}` block has the same effect as the `<User>{:prompt}` block.


```prompt copy filename="system_example.prompt"
<System>
You are a friendly pirate and respond as friendly pirate would.
</System>
```


### Functions

Use the `<Functions>{:prompt}` block to integrate a tool that PromptFile can execute at runtime. Note that this block is only valid in specific OpenAI models. Currently, only `gpt-4-0613` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` support tool usage.

In this example, we define a function called `calculator`. We also input a `testValue` that our function (which is implemented elsewhere in our project) would return.


```prompt copy filename="functions.prompt"
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613
---

<Functions>
[
  {
    "name": "calculator",
    "description": "Calculates the result of a math expression using JavaScript `eval`.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "expression": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The expression to evaluate in JavaScript."
        }
      },
      "required": ["expression"]
    },
    "testValue": "1.08933674"
  }
]
</Functions>


<User>
what is 2 to the .12345 power?
</User>
```

If you run this PromptFile, you will get the following output. Notice the automatically generated `<Function>{:prompt}` which includes our `testValue`. In the Playground, another request is made if our function returns something.

```prompt
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613
---


<User >
what is 2 to the .12345 power?
</User>


<Assistant type="function_call">
{
  "name": "calculator",
  "arguments": "{\n  \"expression\": \"2 ** 0.12345\"\n}"
}
</Assistant>


<Function name="calculator">
"1.08933674"
</Function>


<Assistant >
2 to the power of 0.12345 is approximately 1.08933674.
</Assistant>
```

### Function

The `<Function>{:prompt}` block is automatically generated and used to track the results of a function evaluation. For example, here is a sample PromptFile that declares a function called "calculator".

 - **name** <i>(string)</i> The name of the function which was called.

```prompt copy filename="function_example.prompt"
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613
---


<Functions>
[
  {
    "name": "calculator",
    "description": "Calculates the result of a math expression using JavaScript `eval`.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "expression": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The expression to evaluate in JavaScript."
        }
      },
      "required": ["expression"]
    },
    "testValue": "1.08933674"
  }
]
</Functions>


<User>
what is 2 to the .12345 power?
</User>
```


When we run this Promptfile file, we get the following interaction:

```prompt
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613
---


<Functions>
[
  {
    "name": "calculator",
    "description": "Calculates the result of a math expression.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "expression": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The expression to evaluate in JavaScript.",
        },
      },
      "required": ["expression"],
    },
  }
]
</Functions>


<User>
what is 2 to the .12345 power?
</User>


This is the assistant deciding to use the calculator tool and pass in arguments into the schema based on the request
<Assistant type="function_call">
{
  "name": "calculator",
  "arguments": "{\n  \"expression\": \"Math.pow(2, 0.12345)\"\n}"
}
</Assistant>


// This is the automatically generated function block letting you know that the LLM used the tool it had available
<Function name="calculator">
"1.0893367441616877"
</Function>


<Assistant>
2 to the power of 0.12345 is approximately 1.08934.
