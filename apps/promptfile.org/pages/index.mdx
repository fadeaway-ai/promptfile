# Promptfile: Engineer Prompts Faster

Promptfile is a Markdown-like templating syntax and playground designed to write and iterate on prompts easier and faster. Promptfile is entirely open-source and free-to-use.

Build and prototype your prompts where you and your projects live: **_VS Code_**.


The simple, human-readable syntax of a `.prompt` file makes it easy to understand and debug. To test your prompt, execute a single command and view the results of your request in the VS Code Playground.

Once your prompt is ready, call a function to load in your prompt in the language of your choice, a seamless and unobtrusive integration of Promptfile into your project.

## Key Features

<Steps>
### **Never leave VS Code**
   - Enjoy syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and tools like GitHub Copilot to bring a developer experience to writing prompts.
### **Separate Code from Prompt**
   - Code behaves predictably, prompts don't. Separate concerns and gain more control of your project.
### **Built for Quick Iteration**
   - Switch between model providers with one line, monitor token usage, and test in real-time.
</Steps>

## Quickstart
Get up-and-running in less than a couple of minutes. For detailed instructions, refer to our [Getting Started Guide](/guide).

<Steps>
### **Install the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass)**
Add your OpenAI or Anthropic API Key by running the "Promptfile: open settings", command in the VS Code Command Palette. For further assistance, see [here](/guide#saving-your-api-keys).

### **Create your first `.prompt` file**
Create a file named `example.prompt` and copy the provided `example.prompt` file into it.

```prompt copy filename="example.prompt"
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
---

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.
</System>

<User>
Write me a haiku about the ocean
</User>
```

### **Run the `.prompt` file: `Command (âŒ˜) + Enter (â†©)`**
The Promptfile [Playground](/playground) should appear and run your Promptfile file.

### **See more Promptfile Features in our [Cookbook](/examples)**
Explore the examples in the Cookbook to learn how to use Promptfile.

## Promptfile: Why Use It?

Promptfile is a better templating syntax and playground for your prompts. If the early stages of your project involve writing a prompt, we want that to be the most frictionless part of your project. Promptfile eliminates the hassle of parsing, concatenating, and formatting requests to the LLM and allows you to iterate and test much quicker. We found ourselves spending most of our time editing prompts on OpenAI's playground and exporting them as messy JSONs we would never touch again. Like you, we wanted speed and to iterate quickly. We wanted to focus on the actual task at hand: building something with LLMs that people wanted.

Try Promptfile and see the difference:

  while (oddIntegers.length < 10) {
    const randomInt = Math.floor(Math.random() * 21)

    if (randomInt % 2 !== 0) {
      oddIntegers.push(randomInt)
    }
