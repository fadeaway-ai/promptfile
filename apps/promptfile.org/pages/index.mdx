# PromptFile: Engineer Prompts Faster

PromptFile is a Markdown-like templating syntax and playground designed to write and iterate on prompts easier and faster. PromptFile is entirely open-source and free-to-use.

Build and prototype your prompts where you and your projects live: **_VSCode_**.


The simple, human-readable syntax of a `.prompt` file makes it easy to understand and debug. To test your prompt, execute a single command and view the results of your request in the VSCode Playground.

Once your prompt is ready, call a function to load in your prompt in the language of your choice, a seamless and unobtrusive integration of PromptFile into your project.

## Key Features

<Steps>
### **Never leave VSCode**
   - Enjoy syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and tools like GitHub Co-Pilot to bring a developer experience to writing prompts.
### **Separate Code from Prompt**
   - Code behaves predictably, prompts don't. Separate concerns and gain more control of your project.
### **Built for Quick Iteration**
   - Switch between model providers with one line, monitor token usage, and test in real-time.
</Steps>

## Quickstart
Get up-and-running in less than a couple ofminutes. For detailed instructions, refer to our [Getting Started Guide](/guide).

<Steps>
### **Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass)**
Add your OpenAI or Anthropic API Key by running the "PromptFile: open settings", command in the VSCode Command Palette. For further assistance, see [here](/guide#saving-your-api-keys).

### **Create your first `.prompt` file**
Create a file named `example.prompt` and copy the provided `example.prompt` file into it.

```prompt copy filename="example.prompt"

model: gpt-3.5-turbo
---

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.
</System>

<User>
Write me a haiku about the ocean
</User>
```

### **Run the `.prompt` file: `Command (âŒ˜) + Enter (â†©)`**
The PromptFile [Playground](/playground) should appear and run your PromptFile file.

### **See more PromptFile Features in our [Cookbook](/examples)**
Explore the examples in the Cookbook to learn about PromptFile' many features.

## PromptFile: Simple and Effective Templating

Just like you, we want to build using large language models. Parsing, concatenating, and formatting requests to the LLM is annoying. Markdown and MDX help to simplify writing prompts, but aren't made with prompts in mind.

When our projects got more complex, we spent more time on prompts. Prompt complexity increased, and with OpenAI's function calling mixing code and prompts, writing and iterating prompts got much harder and slower.

That's where PromptFile comes in. A `.prompt` file is easy to write and can be transpiled into your chosen language as a function. Just call the function in your project to get your prompt ready to make the request to the LLM.

Using PromptFile is simple, so you can concentrate on what's important: building amazing things.
