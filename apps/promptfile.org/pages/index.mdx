# PromptFile: Iterate and build prompts quickly

PromptFile is an open-source templating syntax and playground made to write and iterate on prompts.

Build and prototype your prompts where you and your projects live: **_VSCode_**.

The syntax of a `.prompt` file is straightforward and human-readable. Quickly prototype your prompts without worrying about anything else. When you want to test your prompt, hit one command and get the results streamed in the PromptFile Playground.

Once your prompt is ready, call a function to load in your prompt in the language of your choice, a seamless and unobtrusive integration of PromptFile into your project.

## Key Features

<Steps>
### **Build in VSCode**
   - Get syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and existing tools like GitHub Co-Pilot to make the prompt writing experience as similar to writing code as possible.
### **Separate code from prompt**
   - Code behaves predictably, prompts don't. Separate concerns and gain more control of your project.
### **Made for Prompt Iteration**
   - Switch between model providers, monitor token usage, and test in real-time. Rapidly test your prompt as you would your code.
</Steps>

## Quickstart
Get up-and-running in less than a couple ofminutes. For detailed instructions, refer to our [Getting Started Guide](/guide).

<Steps>
### **Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-prompt)**
Add your OpenAI or Anthropic API Key by running the "PromptFile: open settings", command in the VSCode Command Palette. For further assistance, see [here](/guide#saving-your-api-keys).

### **Create your first `.prompt` file**
Create a file named `example.prompt` and copy the provided `example.prompt` file into it.

```prompt copy filename="example.prompt"

## Experience the PromptFile difference

Dealing with JSON requests can be tedious and not very intuitive. PromptFile addresses this issue by offering a more readable and developer-friendly approach to prompting large language models. It brings the benefits of Markdown or MDX, tailor-made for writing prompts.

With PromptFile in the VSCode playground, you'll enjoy better readability and effortless iteration on your prompts. But PromptFile is more than just a templating syntax â€“ it simplifies the prompting process and enhances the overall development experience.

Check out the side-by-side comparison of a prompt in JSON format compared to its PromptFile version. Experience firsthand how PromptFile improves your workflow and makes crafting prompts a smoother, more efficient task.


PromptFile provides a more readable and intuitive alternative to traditional JSON requests. It offers the same benefits as Markdown or MDX but adds more functionality specifically designed for writing prompts. This makes your prompts not only more readable but also easier to iterate on, especially in the PromptFile Playground.
