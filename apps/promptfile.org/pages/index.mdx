# PromptFile: Iterate and build prompts quickly

PromptFile is an open-source templating syntax and playground made to write and iterate on prompts.

Build and prototype your prompts where you and your projects live: **_VSCode_**.

The syntax of a `.prompt` file is straightforward and human-readable. Quickly prototype your prompts without worrying about anything else. When you want to test your prompt, hit one command and get the results streamed in the PromptFile Playground.

Once your prompt is ready, call a function to load in your prompt in the language of your choice, a seamless and unobtrusive integration of PromptFile into your project.

## Key Features

<Steps>
### **Built for VSCode**
   - Get syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and existing tools like GitHub Co-Pilot to make the prompt writing experience as similar to writing code as possible.
### **Separate Code from Prompt**
   - Code behaves predictably, prompts don't. Separate concerns and gain more control of your project.
### **Made for Prompt Iteration**
   - Switch between model providers, monitor token usage, and test in real-time. Rapidly test your prompt as you would your code.
</Steps>

## Quickstart
Get up-and-running in less than a couple ofminutes. For detailed instructions, refer to our [Getting Started Guide](/guide).

<Steps>
### **Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-prompt)**
Add your OpenAI or Anthropic API Key by running the "PromptFile: open settings", command in the VSCode Command Palette. For further assistance, see [here](/guide#saving-your-api-keys).

### **Create your first `.prompt` file**
Create a file named `example.prompt` and copy the provided `example.prompt` file into it.

```prompt copy filename="example.prompt"
<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.
</System>

<User>
Write me a haiku about the ocean
</User>
```

### **Run the `.prompt` file: `Command (âŒ˜) + Enter (â†©)`**
The PromptFile [Playground](/playground) should appear and run your PromptFile file.

### **See more PromptFile Features in our [Cookbook](/examples)**
Explore the examples in the Cookbook to learn about PromptFile' many features.

## PromptFile is dead-simple, that's why we love it

Like you, we just want to build. We don't want to deal with parsing, concatenating, and formatting requests to the LLM. Solutions like Markdown and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) are fantastic. We love them.

Soon, our projects got more complex. We spent more time working on prompts. Our prompts got more complex. With OpenAI's function calling, it got even more complicated to separate out our code from our prompts.

PromptFile is our dead-simple solution. We take a `.prompt` file and transpile it into your preferred language to use in your project.

{/*Maybe choose a different example that is more intuitive to see how you can interpolate variables and then pass the variables into */}
