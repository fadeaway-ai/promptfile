# Cookbook (Examples)

The Promptfile Cookbook provides a collection of practical examples that demonstrate Promptfile' capabilities.

<Steps>

{/*Need to decide what other examples to use....most of them are pretty vanilla!!! Nothing crazy*/}

### **Declaring Variables**

To declare variables for interpolation within your prompt template, use the `@{variableName}` syntax. Ensure that all variables are placed within a block.

```prompt copy filename="haiku.prompt"
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
---

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku. In your response, add new lines to format the haiku.
</System>

<User>
@{myFirstVariable}
</User>
```

### **Calling functions**

Employ the `<Tool>{:prompt}` block to create a tool (or function) that enhances the model's ability to perform tasks. In this case, a calculator is provided as a resource for the LLM to use in accomplishing its task.

Define the tool by specifying its parameters, which include the name of the tool, a description of the tool, the schema the LLM needs to return to execute the function, and the intended function to run. In this example, we use [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to parse and validate the data.

Please note that, as of now, only `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` and `gpt-4-0613` models have been fine-tuned to effectively call functions.

```prompt
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613
---


<Functions>
[
  {
    "name": "calculator",
    "description": "Calculates the result of a math expression.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "expression": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The expression to evaluate in JavaScript.",
        },
      },
      "required": ["expression"],
    },
  }
]
</Functions>
