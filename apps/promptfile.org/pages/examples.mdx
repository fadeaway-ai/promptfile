# Cookbook (Examples)

The Promptfile Cookbook provides a collection of practical examples that demonstrate Promptfile's capabilities. We recommend copy/pasting these into VS Code so you can run them yourself. We added comments to help you understand what's happening.

<Steps>

### **Chatting with your prompt**

Here is a static prompt. Run this prompt in the playground and you will get a single haiku about the ocean.

If you want to continue the interaction, you can input something into `Response` and running it again. The Playground appends a `<User>{:prompt}` block with your `Response` inside to your session. You can view the raw session file by clicking `Open session file`.

```prompt
---
model: gpt-4
temperature: 1
maxTokens: 2048
---

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.
</System>


Feel free to change this text to anything you want!
<User>
Tell me about the ocean.
</User>
```
### **Including variables in your template**

You can also include variables in your template using the `@{variableHere}{:prompt}`. This allows you to have a more dynamic prompt. When using your prompt in your project, you can pass these variables in as arguments.

```prompt
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
---

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.

Include at least one emoji per response.
</System>

<User>
Here's what I want my Haiku to be about: @{haikuTopic}
</User>
```

### **Calling functions**

Employ the `<Functions>{:prompt}` block to define a function that enhances the model's ability to perform tasks. If your function returns something, it will be wrapped inside a `<Function>{:prompt}` block. For the purposes of the demo example, we include a `testValue` that our function would return.

Please note that only `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` and `gpt-4-0613` models have been fine-tuned to call functions.

```prompt
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo-0613
---

<Functions>
[
  {
    "name": "calculator",
    "description": "Calculates the result of a math expression using JavaScript `eval`.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "expression": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The expression to evaluate in JavaScript."
        }
      },
      "required": ["expression"]
    },
    "testValue": "1.08933674"
  }
]
</Functions>

<User>
what is 2 to the .12345 power?
