# Getting Started Guide

This guide offers a more comprehensive introduction to getting started with Promptfile.

<Steps>

### **Installing the extension**
Install the Promptfile VS Code extension through the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass).

### **Creating your first `.prompt` file**

After installing the extension, open up a workspace and create a new file called `example.prompt`. Copy/paste the following content:

```prompt copy filename="example.prompt"
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
---

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku. In your response, add new lines to format the haiku.
</System>

<User>
The ocean is so big! I wonder what is out there. I want to explore.
</User>
```

### **Saving your API Keys**

Save your keys in Promptfile settings by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P,` searching for Promptfile: open settings, and pasting your keys in the VS Code settings.

Alternatively, you can set your API keys in your environment as either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

<Callout type="info">Note: Promptfile does not store or log your API keys. They are saved locally. </Callout>

### **Running your first `.prompt` file**

When you are ready to run the file, run the `.prompt` file by running the VS Code Command Palette `Promptfile: run in playground` command.

You can run your file by pressing `Command (⌘) Enter (↩)`.

Alternatively, you can access the VS Code Command Palette by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P,` and searching for `Promptfile: run in playground`.
<br />

### **Trying different models**

You can try different models by changing the model name in the header of your `.prompt` file. Right now we support OpenAI and Anthropic models. You can see a full list [here](/models). Remember to put your API keys and that you can only use models you have access to (for example, if you don't have access to `gpt-4-32k` you will get an error message).

### **Using it in your project**

When you are ready to use your Promptfile in your project, run "Promptfile: transpile to another language" via the VS Code Command Palette. You will be able to choose which language to compile into, currently the following are [supported](/code).

You can then import your Promptfile into your project and then call the function, passing in the variables you want to declare in your template.
