# Getting Started with Promptfile

This comprehensive guide walks you through the steps to get started with Promptfile.

<Steps>

### **Extension Installation**
Begin by installing the Promptfile extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass).

### **Creating Your Initial `.prompt` File**

Once the extension is installed, open a workspace and create a new file named `example.prompt`. Insert the following content into it:

```prompt copy filename="example.prompt"
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
---

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku. In your response, add new lines to format the haiku.
</System>

<User>
The ocean is so big! I wonder what is out there. I want to explore.
</User>
```

### **Storing Your API Keys**

Store your keys in Promptfile settings by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P,` searching for "Promptfile: open settings," and entering your keys in the VS Code settings.

Alternatively, you can assign your API keys to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variables, which will be used by the Promptfile playground.

<Callout type="info">Note: Your API keys are stored locally and are not logged or saved by Promptfile. </Callout>

### **Running Your Initial `.prompt` File**

To execute your `.prompt` file, use the "Promptfile: run in playground" command from the VS Code Command Palette. Access the Command Palette by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P` and then search for "Promptfile: run in playground."

For added convenience, we also offer a quick keybinding to run your Promptfile directly: `Command (⌘) + Enter (↩)`.

### **Experimenting with Different Models**

Experiment with different models by changing the model name in your `.prompt` file's header. Currently, OpenAI and Anthropic models are supported. View a complete list [here](/models). Ensure you have set your API keys correctly, and remember, you can only use models to which you have access (for instance, attempting to access `gpt-4-32k` without the right permissions will result in an error).

### **Integrating into Your Project**

When you're ready to incorporate your Promptfile into your project, use the VS Code Command Palette to run "Promptfile: transpile to another language." You'll be able to select the target language from the [supported](/code) options.

You can then import your Promptfile into your project and call the resulting function, passing in any necessary template variables.
