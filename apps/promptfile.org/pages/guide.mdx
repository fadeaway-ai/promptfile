# Getting Started Guide

This guide offers a more comprehensive introduction to getting started with Promptfile.

<Steps>

### **Installing the extension**

Install the Promptfile VS Code extension through the VSCode Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass).

### **Creating your first `.glass` file**

After installing the extension, open up a workspace and create a new file called `example.glass`. Copy/paste the following content:

```prompt copy filename="example.glass"
<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku. In your response, add new lines to format the haiku.
</System>

<User>
The ocean is so big! I wonder what is out there. I want to explore.
</User>

<Request model="gpt-3.5-turbo" />
```

### **Saving your API Keys**

Save your keys in Promptfile settings by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P,` searching for Promptfile: open settings, and pasting your keys in the VSCode settings.

Alternatively, you can set your API keys on your environment as either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

When you are ready to run the file, run the Promptfile file by running the VSCode Command Palette `Promptfile: run` command. You can access the VSCode Command Palette by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P,` and searching for `Promptfile: run`.
