# Getting Started Guide

This guide offers a more comprehensive introduction to getting started with PromptFile.

<Steps>

### **Installing the extension**
{/*Need to put in new VSCode marketplace link when extension is published*/}
Install the PromptFile VSCode extension through the VSCode Marketplace [here]().

### **Creating your first `.prompt` file**

After installing the extension, open up a workspace and create a new file called `example.prompt`. Copy/paste the following content:

```prompt copy filename="example.prompt"
<System>

</User>
```

### **Saving your API Keys**

Save your keys in PromptFile settings by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P,` searching for PromptFile: open settings, and pasting your keys in the VSCode settings.
