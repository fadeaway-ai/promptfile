# Getting Started Guide

This guide offers a more comprehensive introduction to getting started with PromptFile.

<Steps>

### **Installing the extension**
{/*Need to put in new VSCode marketplace link when extension is published*/}
Install the PromptFile VSCode extension through the VSCode Marketplace [here]().

### **Creating your first `.prompt` file**

After installing the extension, open up a workspace and create a new file called `example.prompt`. Copy/paste the following content:

```prompt copy filename="example.prompt"
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
---

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku. In your response, add new lines to format the haiku.
</System>

<User>
The ocean is so big! I wonder what is out there. I want to explore.
</User>
```

### **Saving your API Keys**

Save your keys in PromptFile settings by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P,` searching for PromptFile: open settings, and pasting your keys in the VSCode settings.

Alternatively, you can set your API keys in your environment as either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

<Callout type="info">Note: PromptFile does not store or log your API keys. They are saved locally. </Callout>

### **Running your first `.prompt` file**

When you are ready to run the file, run the `.prompt` file by running the VSCode Command Palette `PromptFile: run in playground` command.

You can run your file by pressing `Command (⌘) Enter (↩)`.

Alternatively, you can access the VSCode Command Palette by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P,` and searching for `PromptFile: run in playground`.

### **Trying different models**

You can try different models by changing the model name in the header of your `.prompt` file. Right now we support OpenAI and Anthropic models. You can see a full list [here](/models). Remember to put your API keys and that you can only use models you have access to (for example, if you don't have access to `gpt-4-32k` you will get an error message).

### **Using it in your project**

When you are ready to use your PromptFile in your project, run "Promptfile: transpile to another language" via the VSCode Command Palette. You will be able to choose which language to compile into, currently the following are [supported](/code).

For example after transpiling
