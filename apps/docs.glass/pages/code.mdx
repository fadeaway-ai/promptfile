  Note: Executing code inside your Glass file or transpiling your Glass prompt to use in your project is highly
  experimental and presents challenges to some users. We are actively working on improving it. If you want to use Glass
  in your project, message us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/H64PFP2DCc){' '}
</Callout>

## Executable Code

Glass has experimental support for an element called `<Code>` which lets you write code to be executed before the prompt is evaluated. This is useful for fetching data, running calculations, or executing any other code that you want to run before prompting the LLM.

You can update your default langauge in [VSCode settings](/vscode) or by adding a language to the frontmatter of your file.

```glass
all text between prompt blocks is treated as code, including comments

<Code language="typescript">
const myMessage = "This is code! You can define which language you want in the frontmatter or adjust your default language in your VSCode settings."
</Code>


<System>
${myMessage}
</System>

<Request model="gpt-3.5-turbo" />
```

## Transpiling `.glass`

After perfecting your prompt, transpile it to your preferred language for integration with your codebase.

To transpile: run `Glass: transpile` from the VS Code Command Palette (`Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P`).

For an alternative language, modify the `Default Language Mode` setting in Glass settings. Note that Python transpilation is less tested than JavaScript or TypeScript transpilation. If you run into issues, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/H64PFP2DCc).

## Using `.glass` in code

You can now call the transpiled `example` function from your codebase.

<Tabs items={['JavaScript / TypeScript']}>
  <Tab>

```typescript
import { Glass } from './glass'

const prompt = Glass.example({})

console.log(prompt)
```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>
