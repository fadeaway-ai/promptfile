  Note: Executing code inside your Glass file or transpiling your Glass prompt to use in your project is highly
  experimental and presents challenges to some users. We are actively working on improving it. If you want to use Glass
  in your project, message us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/H64PFP2DCc){' '}
</Callout>

## Executable Code

Anything not wrapped inside of a block is evaluated as code. This means you can define variables and functions.

You can update your default langauge in [VSCode settings](/vscode) or by adding a language to the frontmatter of your file.

```glass-ts
---
language: typescript
---

// all text between prompt blocks is treated as code, including comments
const myMessage = "This is code! You can define which language you want in the frontmatter or adjust your default language in your VSCode settings."
<System>
${myMessage}
</System>
```

## Fenced Code Snippets

Glass supports normal Markdown fenced code snippets. You can specify the language of the code snippet by adding the language name after the opening backticks. For example, to create a fenced code block with JavaScript syntax highlighting, you could use:

````glass-py
<System>
You are a python programmer. You should always respond with fenced code blocks like this:

```py
foo = 5
bar = 10
result = foo + bar
print(result)
```
</System>
````

## Transpiling `.glass`

After perfecting your prompt, transpile it to your preferred language for integration with your codebase.

To transpile: run `Glass: transpile` from the VS Code Command Palette (`Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P`).

For an alternative language, modify the `Default Language Mode` setting in Glass settings. Note that Python transpilation is less tested than JavaScript or TypeScript transpilation. If you run into issues, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/H64PFP2DCc).

## Using `.glass` in code

You can now call the transpiled `example` function from your codebase.

<Tabs items={['JavaScript / TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>

```glass-ts
import { Glass } from './glass'

const prompt = Glass.example({})

console.log(prompt)
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

```python
import glass

prompt = glass.example({})

print(prompt)
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
