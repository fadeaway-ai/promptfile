# **Glass: Iterate and build prompts quickly**

Introducing Glass: a powerful, open-source templating syntax and VSCode playground engineered for crafting prompts for large language models (LLMs). Effortlessly create and refine prompts within your project workspace, delivering a developer-focused experience.

Initially, we managed prompts through lengthy strings in our codebase, but soon transitioned to utilizing [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for enhanced readability and separation of concerns. As our needs evolved, we sought more advanced features tailored to prompt development, leading to the creation of Glass.

Once you've fine-tuned your prompt, Glass makes it easy to generate a function for integration into your project with just a single line of code.


## Key Features

<Steps>
### **Seamless VSCode Integration**
- Craft and refine prompts with syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and compatible tools like GitHub Copilot, all within VSCode.
### **Advanced Prompt Design**
- Develop dynamic templates incorporating conditional logic, state management, and multiple model requests.
### **Optimized for LLMs**
- Benefit from built-in token counting, effortless model switching, and comprehensive diagnostic insights for your requests.
</Steps>



## Quickstart
Follow these simple steps to get started quickly. For more details, refer to our [Getting Started Guide](/guide).
<Steps>
### Install the [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass)
Add your OpenAI or Anthropic API Key by executing the `Glass: open settings` command in the VSCode Command Palette. Refer to our guide on [saving your OpenAI and/or Anthropic keys](/guide#save-your-openai-andor-anthropic-keys) for help.

### Create Your First Glass File
Open a new or existing VSCode workspace and create a file named `example.glass`. Insert the following content:

```glass copy filename="example.glass"
<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.
</System>
<User>
The ocean is so big! I wonder what is out there. I want to explore.
</User>
<Request model="gpt-3.5-turbo" />
```
### Execute your Glass file with  `Command (⌘) Enter (↩)`
Congratulations! You've run your first Glass file, but there's so much more to explore.

### Explore our [Cookbook](/examples) to see more of Glass' features

## Experience the Glass difference

Dealing with JSON requests can be tedious and not very intuitive. Glass addresses this issue by offering a more readable and developer-friendly approach to prompting large language models. It brings the benefits of Markdown or MDX, tailor-made for writing prompts.

With Glass in the VSCode playground, you'll enjoy better readability and effortless iteration on your prompts. But Glass is more than just a templating syntax – it simplifies the prompting process and enhances the overall development experience.

Check out the side-by-side comparison of a prompt in JSON format compared to its Glass version. Experience firsthand how Glass improves your workflow and makes crafting prompts a smoother, more efficient task.
