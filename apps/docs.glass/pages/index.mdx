# Glass: play with your prompts in VSCode

Glass is an open-source templating syntax and VSCode playground for constructing prompts for large language models (LLMs). Although Glass is still in early alpha and we hope to support its usage in projects, we're excited to share it currently as a way for developers to quickly iterate on prompts in VSCode.

## Key Features

- **Integrated VSCode experience** - Write prompts in VSCode and get your responses streamed straight where you work
- **Design sophisticated prompts** - Create dynamic templates with conditional logic and multiple model requests
- **Made for developers** - Count tokens, switch between models, and get diagnostics for your requests

## Getting Started

1. Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass)
2. Copy some examples from our [Cookbook](/examples) and run them by pressing `Command (⌘) Enter (↩)`
3. For a detailed walkthrough, refer to the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide.

## The Glass Difference

Our JSON requests would look a little something like this....with Glass, you can write the same request in a more readable and intuitive way. With Glass, we got all the benefits of something like Markdown or MDX, but purpose-built for writing prompts. As our prompts got more complex, we wanted even more features.

The user may ask you to make changes to the code based on different needs, your job is to update the code to meet their requests.

User: How do I add two numbers in TypeScript?
Assistant:

```ts

</System>

<User>
Write me a function that creates an array of 10 random odd integers between 0 and 20
</User>

<Assistant>

```ts
function generateRandomOddIntegers(): number[] {
  const oddIntegers: number[] = []

  while (oddIntegers.length < 10) {
    const randomInt = Math.floor(Math.random() * 21)

    if (randomInt % 2 !== 0) {
      oddIntegers.push(randomInt)
    }
  }

  return oddIntegers
}

// Usage example
const randomOddIntegers = generateRandomOddIntegers()
console.log(randomOddIntegers)
```
