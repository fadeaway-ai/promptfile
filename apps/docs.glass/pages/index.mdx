# Glass

Glass is an open-source, declarative framework for constructing prompts for large language models (LLMs). We want to simplify the process of building and iterating prompts for developers.

## Key Features

- **Stay in VSCode** -Test and iterate within your familiar VSCode environment
- **Design sophisticated, dynamic prompts** -Create templates, add conditional logic, and intuitively chain prompts together
- **Developer-first features** -Count tokens, switch between models, and create test cases

## Getting Started

1. Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass)
2. Clone the [demo folder](https://github.com/glass-lang/glass/tree/main/apps/demo/examples)
3. Read through the examples and try editing them
4. For a detiled walkthrough, refer to [Quickstart](/quickstart).

## Before Glass

Initially, we were writing prompts as strings in our codebase, which quickly became unwieldy and hard to debug. We separated our file into a[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) file which was a significnat improvement. We started to extend features of MDX to help us write prompts and that's how Glass was born.

Here was the exact prompt that made us want something like Glass. We found ourselves using LLMs to help debug and write code. We wanted it to **LOOK** and **FEEL** like code.

```ts
/**
 * Construct a few-shot request to ask the LLM to write some basic code.
 */
function makeRequest(task: string) {
  return [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: `You are a highly-intelligent AI that writes amazing JavaScript code.

Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks below given the following schema:

\`\`\`ts
interface User {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
}
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `delete the firstName field`,
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: `\`\`\`js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  delete newRow.firstName
  return newRow
})
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `update age to 22`,
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: `\`\`\`js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  newRow.age = 22
  return newRow
})
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `${task}`,
    },
  ]
}
```

## After Glass

Here's what the same prompt looks like in Glass:

````glass-ts
<System>
You are a highly-intelligent AI that writes amazing JavaScript code.

Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks below given the following schema:

```ts
interface User {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
}
```
</System>


<User>
delete the firstName field
</User>


<Assistant>
```js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  delete newRow.firstName
  return newRow
})
```
</Assistant>


<User>
update age to 22
</User>


<Assistant>
```js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  newRow.age = 22
  return newRow
})
```
</Assistant>


<User>
${task}
</User>
````
