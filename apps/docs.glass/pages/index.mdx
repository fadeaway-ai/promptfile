# **Glass: Iterate and build prompts quickly**

Glass is an open-source templating syntax and VSCode playground specifically designed for crafting prompts to large language models (LLMs).

By enabling users to work within the familiar VSCode environment, Glass eliminates the need for external services like OpenAI's Playground to iterate quickly on prompts.

Featuring an intuitive and straightforward syntax, Glass makes it easy for users to learn and apply the language effectively.

Once your prompt is ready, generate a function with just a single line of code, ensuring seamless integration of Glass into your project.

## Key Features

<Steps>
### **Build in VSCode**
   - Utilize syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and existing tools like GitHub Co-Pilot to make writing prompts as similar as writing code.

### **Construct complex prompts**
   - Design dynamic templates with conditional logic, state management, and multiple model requests in a single prompt.

### **Iterate quicker**
   - Effortlessly switch between models, edit your prompt, and test in real-time.
</Steps>



## Quickstart
<Steps>
For detailed instructions, refer to our [Getting Started Guide](/guide).

### 1. Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass)
Add your OpenAI or Anthropic API Key by running the `Glass: open settings` command in the VSCode Command Palette. For further assistance, follow this [guide](/guide#save-your-openai-andor-anthropic-keys).

### 2. Create your first Glass file
Create a dedicated workspace for your Glass files. Then, create a file named `example.glass` and copy the provided contents into it.

```glass copy filename="example.glass"
<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.
</System>
<User>
Write me a haiku about the ocean
</User>
<Request model="gpt-3.5-turbo" />
```
### 3. Run the Glass File: `Command (⌘) + Enter (↩)`
The [Playground](/playground) should appear and run your Glass file.

### 4. See more Glass Features in our [Cookbook](/examples)
Explore the examples in the Cookbook to learn about Glass' many features.

### 5. Connect with Others and Share Your Work
Join the Glass community on [Discord](www.discord.glass).

## The Glass Difference

Glass provides a more readable and intuitive alternative to traditional JSON requests. It offers the same benefits as Markdown or MDX but is specifically designed for writing prompts. This makes your prompts not only more readable but also easier to iterate on, especially in the VSCode playground.
