# Glass

Glass is an open-source, declarative framework to write prompts for large language models (LLMs). We built Glass to help us build and iterate with our prompts much easier.

- **Stay in VSCode** - Iterate and test your prompts where you work... in VSCode
- **Create more complex, dynamic prompts** - Create templates, add conditional logic, and chain prompts together
- **Developer-first features** -Count tokens, switch models quickly, and create test cases

The fastest way to learn about Glass is to install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass) and copy the examples in this [folder](https://github.com/glass-lang/glass/tree/main/apps/demo/examples). The examples in this folder get increasingly more complex and show off various features of Glass. We also recommend reading the [Quickstart](/quickstart).

## Why Glass?

We started with putting gigantic strings in our codebase... and it was a mess. We separated it into a `.yaml` file and that was better, but as our prompts started to get more complex, we wanted more. We started using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and that was a masssive improvement. We started to build extensions of MDX specifically for writing prompts and that's how Glass was born.


Here was the exact prompt that made us want something like Glass. Not only was the prompt hard to read, we were dealing with code which meant we expected things like syntax highlighting and formatting...we wanted it to **LOOK** and **FEEL** like code.
```ts
/**
 * Construct a few-shot request to ask the LLM to write some basic code.
 */
function makeRequest(task: string) {
  return [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: `You are a highly-intelligent AI that writes amazing JavaScript code.

Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks below given the following schema:

\`\`\`ts
interface User {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
}
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `delete the firstName field`,
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: `\`\`\`js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  delete newRow.firstName
  return newRow
})
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `update age to 22`,
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: `\`\`\`js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  newRow.age = 22
  return newRow
})
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `${task}`,
    },
  ]
}
```
Here's what the same prompt looks like in Glass:

````glass-ts

<Assistant>
```js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)

  return newRow
})
```

<User>

</User>
