# Glass: a better playground for writing prompts

Glass is an open-source templating syntax and VSCode playground for constructing prompts for large language models (LLMs). Although Glass is still in early alpha and we hope to support its usage in projects, we're excited to share it as an improved playground alternative for OpenAI and Anthropic models.

## Key Features

- **Integrated VSCode experience** - Test and iterate prompts within VSCode
- **Design sophisticated prompts** - Create dynamic templates with conditional logic and multiple model requests
- **Made for developers** - Count tokens, switch between models, and get diagnostics for your requests

## Getting Started

1. Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass)
2. Clone the [demo folder](https://github.com/glass-lang/glass/tree/main/apps/demo/examples)
3. Read through the examples which show some of Glass' features and try running them in the [playground](/playground) by pressing `Cmd+Enter`
4. For a detiled walkthrough, refer to the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide.

## The Glass Difference

Our JSON requests would look a little something like this....with Glass, you can write the same request in a more readable and intuitive way. With Glass, we got all the benefits of something like Markdown, but purpose-built for writing prompts.
