# Glass: A better playground for writing prompts

Glass is an open-source templating syntax and VSCode playground for constructing prompts for large language models (LLMs). Although Glass is still in early alpha and we hope to support its usage in projects, we're excited to share it as an improved playground alternative for OpenAI and Anthropic models.

## Key Features

- **Integrated VSCode experience** -Test and iterate prompts within VSCode
- **Design sophisticated prompts** -Create dynamic templates with conditional logic and multiple model requests
- **Made for developers** -Count tokens, switch between models, and get diagnostics for your requests

## Getting Started

1. Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass)
2. Clone the [demo folder](https://github.com/glass-lang/glass/tree/main/apps/demo/examples)
3. Read through the examples which show some of Glass' features and try running them in the [playground](/playground) by pressing `Cmd+Enter`
4. For a detiled walkthrough, refer to the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide.

## Before Glass

Before Glass, we wrote all of our prompts in the OpenAI playground. When we felt like we had a good prompt, we would copy it into our codebase and store it as a convoluted string. We found ourselves secretly avoiding changing the prompt because it was so annoying to deal with.

We then separated our file into a [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) file which made our prompts much more readable and easy to debug. It was when we started to extend certain aspects of MDX to help us write prompts that Glass was born.

Here is the exact prompt that made us want something like Glass. We found ourselves realizing that prompts would become a much bigger part of our projects. We wanted our prompts to **LOOK** and **FEEL** more like code.

```ts
/**
 * Construct a few-shot request to ask the LLM to write some basic code.
 */
function makeRequest(task: string) {
  return [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: `You are a highly-intelligent AI that writes amazing JavaScript code.

Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks below given the following schema:

\`\`\`ts
interface User {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
}
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `delete the firstName field`,
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: `\`\`\`js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  delete newRow.firstName
  return newRow
})
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `update age to 22`,
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: `\`\`\`js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  newRow.age = 22
  return newRow
})
\`\`\``,
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: `${task}`,
    },
  ]
}
```

## After Glass

Here's what the same prompt looks like in Glass:

````glass-ts
<System>
You are a highly-intelligent AI that writes amazing JavaScript code.

Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks below given the following schema:

```ts
interface User {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
}
```
</System>


<User>
delete the firstName field
</User>


<Assistant>
```js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  delete newRow.firstName
  return newRow
})
```
</Assistant>


<User>
update age to 22
</User>


<Assistant>
```js
context.rows = context.rows.map(r => {
  const newRow = Object.assign({}, r)
  newRow.age = 22
  return newRow
})
```
</Assistant>


<User>
${task}
</User>
````
