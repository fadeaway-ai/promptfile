# Getting Started Guide

This guide offers a more comprehensive introduction to getting started with Glass.

<Steps>

### Install the extension

Install the Glass VS Code extension through the VSCode Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foundation.vscode-glass) or searching `Glass` inside the Extensions Marketplace

### Creating your first `.glass` file

After installing the extension, create a new file called `example.glass` and copy/paste the following content:

```glass copy filename="example.glass"
<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku. In your response, add new lines to format the haiku.
</System>

```

### Save your API Keys

Save your keys in Glass settings by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P,` searching for Glass: open settings, and pasting your keys in the VSCode settings.

Alternatively, you can set your API keys on your environment as either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
