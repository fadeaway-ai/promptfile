# What is the Playground?

The Glass Playground provides an interactive way to run a Glass file you create and chat with your prompt.

## How to use the Playground

1. Open a Glass file in VSCode.
2. Launch the Playground either by:
   - Pressing `Command (⌘) + Enter (↩)`
   - Executing the `Glass: run in Playground` command from the VSCode command palette which you can access by pressing `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + P`

## Playground Status Indicator

In the Playground, a status indicator appears next to the name of your Glass file. This helps you track the synchronization of the Glass Playground with your file's changes.

If you see an orange dot: the Playground is <i>**not using the most recent version**</i> of your Glass file. To update the Playground with your latest changes, click the New Session button to restart.

The Playground has various features to help you interact with your Glass file and prompt.

- **Transcript Tab** Experiment with your prompt and view results in real-time
- **History Tab** Access past requests and responses. Click a session ID to open up any part of the conversation history as a `Glass` file in a new VSCode tab. Alternatively, click the `Open session file` button.
- **Logs** Click the logs button to view Playground logs for debugging and examining API requests
- **Share** Click the share button to create a sharable GitHub Gist of your Glass file. Set your GitHub access token that allows you to create a Gist via the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/gists/gists?apiVersion=2022-11-28) as `GITHUB_API_KEY` in a `.env` file or in your `.zshrc` file.
- **Token counting** Monitor token usage inside your Glass file at the bottom of the editor. Currently uses <a href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken" target="_blank"> tiktoken</a> to count tokens.
