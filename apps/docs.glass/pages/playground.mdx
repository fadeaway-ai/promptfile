The Glass Playground offers an interactive environment for creating and testing Glass files, allowing you to communicate with your prompt. It features a Monaco-based composer just like VSCode so that the code you write and receive will benefit from syntax highlighting and formatting when surrounded by triple backticks and the language identifier, such as ```js for JavaScript.

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
When making a request in the Playground, a `<Request>{:glass}` block is automatically added, introducing an uninitialized input variable for the user to interact with. A corresponding `<Request>{:glass}` block is also added to the raw session file, with matching arguments from the initial request.

## How to Use the Playground

<Steps>
### Create a folder and create a new Glass file in VSCode
 - Need some inspiration? Check out our examples [here](/examples) and copy one into your Glass file.
### Launch the Playground:
   - Press `Command (⌘) + Enter (↩)`.
   OR
   - execute the `Glass: run` command from the VSCode command palette.
### Review Chat History
- Access your past requests and responses by clicking a session ID. This opens the selected conversation history as a Glass file in a new VSCode tab.
### Monitor Token Usage
- Keep track of your token usage at the bottom of the editor within your Glass file. Glass currently uses [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for token counting.
### Open the session Glass file
- To see what's displayed in the Playground, click `Open session file`.
### Share your Glass file as a GitHub Gist
- Click the share button to create a sharable GitHub Gist of your Glass file. Remember to set your GitHub access token for the GitHub REST API as GITHUB_API_KEY in a .env file or in your .zshrc file. This enables you to create Gists via the API.

## Playground Status Indicator

In the Playground, a status indicator is displayed next to the name of your Glass file. This helps you monitor the synchronization between the Glass Playground and any changes made to your file.

- Orange Dot: If you see an orange dot, it means the Playground is not using the most recent version of your Glass file. To update the Playground with your latest changes, click the New Session button to restart.
- No Dot: Your Playground is using your most recent version of your Glass file.
