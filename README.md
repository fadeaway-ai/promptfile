# PromptFile (`.prompt`)

![main](https://github.com/glass-platform/promptfile/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

_**ALERT: PROMPTFILE IS IN ALPHA AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.**_

PromptFile is a Markdown-like templating syntax and playground designed to write and iterate on prompts easier and faster. PromptFile is entirely open-source and free-to-use.

Build and prototype your prompts where you and your projects live: VSCode.

The simple, human-readable syntax of a `.prompt` file makes it easy to understand and debug. To test your prompt, execute a single command and view the results of your request in the VSCode Playground.

Once your prompt is ready, call a function to load in your prompt in the language of your choice, a seamless and unobtrusive integration of PromptFile into your project.

1. Read our documentation at [promptfile.org](https://promptfile.org)
2. Check out some examples in our [examples repository](https://github.com/glass-platform/promptfile/tree/main/apps/demo/examples).
3. [Download the VSCode extension](http://vscode.glass) to quickly run and iterate on a PromptFile.
