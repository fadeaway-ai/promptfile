## Apps and Packages

This project uses npm workspaces and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/).

### `apps/`

- `vscode-glass`: VS Code extension for Glass
- `docs`: a Next.js/Nextra app serving [docs.glass](https://docs.glass/)
- `demo`: examples of using Glass, some of these are in active development and may not currently work

### `packages/`

- `glassc`: the Glass compiler (generates `.ts`, `.js`, `.py` output from Glass files)
- `glasslib`: Glass client library (runtime for executing Glass compiler generated code)
- `language-server`: LSP server providing Glass intellisense
- `rig`: a React app for the VS Code Glass playground webview
- `ui`: a React component library shared by web applications
- `util`: random utilities shared by packages/apps
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

Usually you'll want to launch the VSCode extension in development mode. Use the `Run Extension` launch configuration (`F5` keybinding). This will automatically run the build step if necessary.

### Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Watch mode

Several packages contain tests that can be run in watch mode: `packages/glasslib`, `packages/glassc`, `packages/util`

```bash
cd $package
npm run test:watch
```

For `packages/glasslib` only, the `test:watch` mode requires you also build in watch mode:

```bash
cd packages/glasslib
npm run dev
```
