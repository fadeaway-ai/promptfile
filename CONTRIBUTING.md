# Contributing Guidelines for Glass

## What contributions are accepted?
We welcome all types of contributions including bug reports, feature requests, documentation fixes, code improvements, and even entire features.

No contribution is too small...it takes a village. Contributing to the community could mean reacting to people's messages in Discord, offering help to the project and to the community.

## Contributing Documentation Fixes/Suggestions

If you want to make an adjustment to documentation with a quick fix, feel free to clone the repository and make some changes in a working branch and then commit those changes. Once you have finished all your changes, create a pull request.

Once the pull request is made, a Glass main contributor will review the PR and work with you on getting the PR merged. Quick documentation changes should be merged pretty quickly. Feel free to message in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1078745198575763526/1111788924499660830) #contribute channel.
