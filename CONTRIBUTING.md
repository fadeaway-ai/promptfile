# Contributing Guidelines for Glass

## Do you welcome first-time open source contributors?

Absolutely we do.

Here is a [guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) we have found helpful when thinking about how to make Glass easy to contribute to. The project is early, but we think it has the potential to help welcome in even more people into playing, building, and shipping LLMs.

## What contributions are accepted?

We welcome all types of contributions including bug reports, feature requests, documentation fixes, code improvements, example Glass files and even entire features.

No contribution is too small...it takes a village. Contributing to the community could mean reacting to people's messages in Discord, offering help to the project and to the community.

## Contributing Documentation Fixes/Suggestions

If you want to make an adjustment to documentation with a quick fix, feel free to clone the repository and make some changes in a working branch and then commit those changes. Once you have finished all your changes, create a pull request.

Once the pull request is made, a Glass main contributor will review the PR and work with you on getting the PR merged. Quick documentation changes should be merged pretty quickly. Feel free to message in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1078745198575763526/1111788924499660830) #contribute channel.

## Contributing Bug Reports/Feature Requests

Open a detailed issue report [here](https://github.com/glass-lang/glass/issues). Follow the issue templates to help provide the most amount of context to get help. There are two different types of issues:

- Bug Reports: Please open a `Community Bug Report`. Follow the issue template and provide as much context as you can
- Feature Requests: Please open a `Community Feature Request` to suggest a new feature. It's helpful if you can provide details on the problem you're trying to solve and how the proposed feature would work. This allows us to have a discussion to determine if the feature is a good fit for the project. Although the project is extremely early, we hope to keep the community up to date with the prioritization and feature roadmap.

## Contributing Code

If you want to make a code fix, feel free to clone the repository and make some changes in a working branch and then commit those changes. Once you have finished all your changes, create a pull request.

Our current CI pipline should help run some checks and tests and we are actively working on improving CI/CD.

Once the pull request is made, a Glass main contributor will review the PR and work with you on getting the PR merged.

While the project is still in its infancy stage, the best way to know what aspects of the project to improve is to message in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1078745198575763526/1111788924499660830) #contribute channel.

## Code of Conduct

All interactions within the Glass open source project are governed by our Community Code of Conduct found [here](https://discord.com/channels/1078745198575763526/1113910049744617554).
